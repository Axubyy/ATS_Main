                I want to share with you my experience in moving to a CTO position. This post will mainly concern management on the technical side, CTOs, VP of Engineering, Heads of Departments, etc.

                In every software engineer‚Äôs life comes a time when they need to decide if they want to pursue a career in engineering or switch to management. There are pros and cons to both of those choices, and it all depends on what your character is like, what you want out of life, and how well you can manage work-life balance.

                I became CTO of a small company (< 40 Employees) a year ago, and that switch made me work harder than ever before; suddenly, the things I needed to do didn‚Äôt fit on a single to-do list, and as the weeks went by the list kept getting bigger. During that year, I finally managed to structure my work, and I would like to share a few things with you that I think are essential and would have made my life easier if I had known them back then.

                        First, you need to keep an eye on some points while transitioning from a developer position to a management position from the same team or just in the same company.

                  <p class="if-p">
                      This is an important one, as otherwise, your teammates will question your management, and there will be a sense of distrust between you and the team. Remember how your manager used to suggest some bizarre stuff to improve the team‚Äôs efficiency? The more respect you have before becoming the manager, the less friction you will have with your ideas that not everyone agrees with.

                  <p class="your-p"> If you want to continue being friends outside of your job, it‚Äôs best to leave work conversations inside the office building. This problem has several sides to it. The first one is that people on your team might view your friendship as a source of bias towards that person. They will assume that if your friend supports you, she is doing that not because it‚Äôs objectively reasonable but also because of friendship.
                  </p>
                  <p class="your-p">
                      Another problem is that there will come a time when you will have to have unpleasant talks with that friend ‚Äì no matter how strongly you support your friend, everyone makes mistakes. And if you don‚Äôt make the unpleasant conversation, then others will see this as unfair.

                    Of course, you can do it better. Of course, you can do it faster. But your time is limited, and other more critical tasks at hand need to be prioritized. Learn to delegate and learn not to look over the shoulder of the person you‚Äôre delegating to. 

                    Assume they will finish the job in a timely matter and as good as you. Only after the person fails to deliver should you talk about your expectation of standard, how fast you expect the tasks to be done, and the result‚Äôs quality.

                    It‚Äôs also possible that once you start doing everything by yourself, people will start expecting the same from you next time.

                  <p class="close-p"> Sadly you will not be able to work alone anymore. The whole workflow of getting a task -> doing the task, -> submitting the job for review without zero human interaction is gone. (Although you will have to maintain that healthy workflow environment for your developers.)
                 The essential quality you will be required to improve is communication. You will need to talk with your developers‚Äîa lot. You will need to speak with your Directors‚Äîa lot. You will have a lot of calls and a lot of emails during the day. That‚Äôs just how it is, and there‚Äôs no way of avoiding it. 

                Unless you maintain a healthy environment bubble around your developers, people will start approaching them directly and annoying them with their stuff. These distractions will make your team unhappy. So take care of communication for them.</p>

Your responsibility now is the company‚Äôs success, so you‚Äôre not allowed to say that you did your part and everything else doesn‚Äôt matter. It matters. 

                    If some other department is causing your team/department speed to slow down, it‚Äôs now your problem. If there‚Äôs a blocker somewhere outside of the company, like with third-party providers ‚Äì you need to sort this out. Either delegate that to someone or solve the problem yourself, but there should be no ‚ÄúOur work/their work‚Äù mentality now.</p>

                            Communication
                            I‚Äôm going to repeat this here as this is so important. The amount of communication you have will increase ten-fold. You will need to hire people. You will have to talk to other people to make them more productive, discuss their problems, etc. Soft skills are critical in any management position.

                                <p class="clare-p">If you think you had stress when you couldn‚Äôt fix a bug or couldn‚Äôt finish enough tasks during a sprint, think again. Now you will be the shield for your developers, so everything negative to your team will go to you. Interesting fact, everything positive will also go your way, so there‚Äôs that.

                                You will have multiple stakeholders pressuring you and think the thing they want is the most important one. Instead of having one manager telling you that you need to work faster, you will have multiple people wanting different things from you and wanting them quickly.

                                You will need to learn how to deal with stress, personal advice ‚Äì meditation, sports, and digital detox during the weekend.

                                Paying attention to your body and taking care of yourself will help you deal with leadership stress.

                                <p class="">  Every decision you make from now on will probably concern your whole team and the company in general. You will need to think about all the trade-offs you‚Äôre making. Decisions usually contain some trade-offs. For example, refactoring some part of the code is a trade-off between current stability and future maintainability. Rewriting some Monolith into a bunch of Microservices is usually a trade-off between scalability, development cost, complexity, performance, and maintenance.

                            Leaders are often responsible for making challenging decisions, such as whether to rewrite the service from scratch, keep an employee, or let them go.</p>

                                        Being in management does not mean that you need to stop watching Coursera videos or doing Udemy courses about Distributed systems. For you as a decision-maker, it‚Äôs crucial to have a broad knowledge of many things. The only way to achieve that is never to stop learning.</p>

As Software Developers, we‚Äôre primarily focused on single bugs or part of a feature without expanding our horizons (during work hours, we can still build side projects with new technology over the weekend). But switching from development to management is a whole new field, and there are just so many new things to learn.</p>
